# LOOPED-MUSIC-VAULT
A Progressive Web App for Discovering Music, Reacting, and Sharing Your Sound

Looped is a full-featured Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to give artists and listeners a dynamic space to experience unreleased music, vote on future releases, record reactions, and personalize their profile. The app works across mobile and desktop devices, supports offline access, and uses local storage to persist user interactions.

This project was developed as part of a mobile application assignment, demonstrating real-world app development using modern web technologies, state management, navigation, and PWA capabilities.
